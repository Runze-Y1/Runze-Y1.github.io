<p class="p1">In 1899 王懿荣 accidentally saw the oracle bone inscriptions. This aroused his curiosity. He thought the scratches resembled ancient writing. In order to find more bones for further study, he collected more than 1,500 pieces. Before wang yirong had time to do in-depth research, the eight-power allied forces approached the city of Beijing, wang yirong was very disappointed with the escape of the royal family, and he did not want to follow the royal family so he committed suicide.We are luckier than wang yirong, and we live in a peaceful country where we can comfortably carry on our culture.</p>


<p class="p2">Chinese has always been a word that people can guess when they see it. Oracle is no exception, I think we can try to guess a few oracle meaning.</p>
